    <!-- ECU Remapping  -->
    <section id="ecu">
      <h2>ECU Remapping</h2>
      <p>
        Software modifications that remap an automobile's electronic control unit (ECU) improve the engine.  
        Manufacturers limit the ECU's ability to manipulate fuel, air, and power for safety and commercial reasons. 
        The benefits of a remap—such as increased horsepower, smoother acceleration, and improved fuel efficiency—depend on the tuning type selected.
        There are three options available: economy, performance, and balanced.
        The remapping must be performed by a certified professional to avoid warranty issues and engine damage.
        When done correctly, it makes driving more enjoyable.

      <h2>Suspension Upgrades</h2>
      <p>
        Upgrading or improving components can make a vehicle's suspension more responsive, stable, and comfortable.  
        The suspension system connects the wheels to the car's structure, affecting safety, stability, and comfort.
        Examples of upgrades include performance bushings, coilovers, improved shock absorbers, and stronger springs.
        Benefits include improved cornering, handling, reduced body sway, and better steering accuracy.
        Choosing quality parts and professional installation is essential to avoid unsafe or uncomfortable rides.

    <!-- Exhaust Systems  -->
    <section id="exhaust">
      <h2>Exhaust Systems</h2>
      <p>
        Upgraded exhaust systems allow exhaust gases to exit the engine more efficiently, enhancing performance.  
        Factory exhausts often focus on cost and noise reduction, while performance systems use larger pipes and better materials for improved efficiency.
        Benefits include increased power, better throttle response, and a sportier exhaust sound.
        High-quality systems are typically made from durable materials such as stainless steel.
        Correct installation ensures improvements in performance, sound, and overall driving experience.

    <!-- Body Kits  -->
    <section id="bodykits">
      <h2>Body Kits</h2>
      <p>
        Body kits include bumpers, side skirts, spoilers, and diffusers, designed to enhance both the look and functionality of a car.
        They improve aerodynamics and stability at high speeds while giving a sportier, more aggressive appearance.
        Quality kits are made from materials like fibreglass, polyurethane, or carbon fibre for durability.
        Proper installation enhances aesthetics, handling, and driving performance.
